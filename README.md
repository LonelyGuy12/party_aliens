# Kill the Party Aliens!

This is a Space Invaders clone, where your objective is to stop the party aliens from invading our planet and instituting a mandatory party rule, which would cause all humans to dance their way into their graves.

### Installing

Follow the steps below to get all prerequisites and game installed.

If you don't already have it, start by installing the latest version of Python 3. For more detailed instructions, visit the link below:
https://realpython.com/installing-python/

Once you have Python 3 installed, you will need to install Pip; which is the preferred method for downloading and installing Python packages.
Downloading Pip
```
curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
```
Installing Pip
```
python get-pip.py
```

With Pip installed, it's now time to install Pygame. In order to do that, simply run the command below on your terminal
```
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

With Pygame installed, you are ready to clone the repo and run Kill the Party Aliens! From your terminal, navigate to the directory where the files are store, then run the following command
```
python3 party_aliens.py
```

## Built With

* [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/) - Main programming language
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) - Library used for building the game 

## Contributing

Please feel free to contribute wherever needed. I want to include new features when possible, but time constraints have held me back. Possible new features would include:
* Aliens shoot back
* Defensive barracks for player's ship
* Sound effects

## Versioning

I have not yet decided on how to do versioning for this game. This was a project designed for learning and familiarizing myself with Python, but I enjoyed being creative with the ideas that helped make this game unique, and would love for it to become something more.
